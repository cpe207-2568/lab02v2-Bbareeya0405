      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece"></i> REGIONAL COMPETITION</h2> 
      <p>Awarded First Runner-up at the Regional Level in the Innovation Competition under the “Coding Skills Enhancement for Local Applications” project. Our team presented an innovation called <span class="highlight">Maximum Flood Warning (MFW)</span></p>
      <p>which uses a Microbit and an Ultrasonic Sensor to detect rising water levels in flood-prone areas such as dams and rivers. When the water reaches a preset level, the system sends an alert to help the community prepare in time. I was responsible for coding and wiring the system within the given 2-day timeframe.</p>

      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece"></i> NATIONAL COMPETITION</h2> 
      <p>I was awarded <span class="highlight">1st Runner-Up </span>at the national level in an innovation competition under a coding skill enhancement training program.</p>
      <p>The project involved using Raspberry Pi with sensors, motors, and more. It aimed to solve flooding in Muno community, Narathiwat. I designed the system and integrated data with the hardware.</p>
